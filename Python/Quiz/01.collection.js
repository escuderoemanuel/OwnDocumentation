// Which collection is ordered, changeable, and allows duplicate members?

let a = 'Dictionary'
let b = 'List'
let c = 'Set'
let d = 'Tuple'

// DICTIONARY: is unordered (prior to Python 3.7), changeable, and does not allow duplicate keys.
// LIST: is ordered, changeable (mutable), and allows duplicate members.
// SET: is unordered, unchangeable (though you can add or remove items), and does not allow duplicate members.
// TUPLE: is ordered, unchangeable (immutable), and allows duplicate members.

//* Correct Option is 'b' -> List

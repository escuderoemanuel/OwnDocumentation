## Fix Bugs

1. Understand the Problem
Reproduce the Issue: Ensure you can consistently reproduce the problem. This helps in verifying if the issue is fixed later.
Gather Information: Note any error messages, logs, or unexpected behavior. Understand what the code is supposed to do and how it deviates.

2. Isolate the Issue
Identify the Scope: Determine which part of the code is causing the problem. This can be done by examining recent changes or using debugging tools.
Simplify the Code: Break down complex code into smaller parts to isolate the issue. Comment out sections or use test cases to narrow down the problem area.

3. Use Debugging Tools
Print Statements: Insert print statements or logging to display variable values and execution flow.
Debugger: Utilize integrated debugging tools in your IDE or text editor to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code.
Profilers: For performance issues, use profilers to identify bottlenecks.

4. Analyze the Code
Check for Common Issues: Look for common problems like syntax errors, logical errors, or off-by-one errors.
Review Algorithm and Logic: Ensure that the algorithm and logic are correct. Validate if the code logic aligns with the intended functionality.

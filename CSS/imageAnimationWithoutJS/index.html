  <h1>Stark Family</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>
      Eddard Stark
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eddard "Ned" Stark is the Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North in the first season of Game of Thrones. He's
      imperfect, but he's often the show's protagonist and moral compass among far more morally ambiguous characters. He
      shares a loving marriage with Catelyn Tully, has strong bonds with his children, and is respected by the people of
      Winterfell and the North. Ned was a childhood friend of Robert Baratheon, and the two fought together to overthrow
      the Mad King, planting Robert on the Iron Throne. Years later, Robert requests Ned to be the next Hand of the
      King.

      His death set the precedent for Game of Thrones to be a series where no one was safe

      Ned's time in King's Landing as Robert's Hand is the catalyst for the show's main stage of events, as Robert's
      death causes a war of succession and civil wars across Westeros. Ned attempts to do the noble thing at every turn,
      misunderstanding the political game in King's Landing, resulting in his execution by Joffrey Baratheon. It can't
      be understated how iconic Eddard Stark is as a culturally impactful TV character. His death set the precedent for
      Game of Thrones to be a series where no one was safe; a risky move that changed the television landscape for years
      following.

    <h2>
      Catelyn Tully
    </h2>
    <p>
      Catelyn Tully is the mother of the Stark family, who fights fiercely for her husband and children throughout the
      early seasons of Game of Thrones. After Eddard Stark's death, Catelyn plays an instrumental role in supporting
      Robb Stark in the War of Five Kings. Catelyn was born a Tully, the noble house of the Riverlands, which brings a
      significant force to Robb's side in the war against the Lannisters. She's tragically killed at the Red Wedding
      along with Robb, though in the books she's brought back to life by Thoros of Myr, becoming known as Lady
      Stoneheart.

    <h2>
      Robb Stark
    </h2>
    <p>
      Robb Stark plays a quiet role in the early episodes of Game of Thrones but quickly becomes prominent after Ned
      Stark is imprisoned. To rescue his father, 16-year-old Robb assembles the armies of the North to march toward
      King's Landing, craftily defeating the renowned military commander Tywin Lannister in battle on multiple
      occasions. After Tywin adjusts his strategy to avoid direct combat, Robb struggles to maintain the respect of his
      followers, ultimately leading to him, his wife, and their unborn child being butchered at the Red Wedding, one of
      the most heartbreaking moments in Game of Thrones.

    <h2>
      Jon Snow
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jon Snow is raised as Ned Stark's bastard son, a position that leaves him constantly cast aside growing up,
      leading to his choice to join the Night's Watch. This begins Jon's journey as one of the main heroes in Game of
      Thrones, growing into a leader to defend the realm against the impending White Walker invasion. Jon does the
      impossible by bringing the wildlings and Night's Watch together to fight for the living, even being killed for it.
      Following his resurrection, Jon defeats Ramsay Bolton in the Battle of the Bastards and becomes King in the North.

      Jon Snow is later revealed to be the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, making him the rightful heir to
      the Iron Throne

      Jon Snow is later revealed to be the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, making him the rightful heir to
      the Iron Throne. Having developed a romance with Daenerys Targaryen, his being a Targaryen heir becomes a burden
      he doesn't want, and instead swears himself to her. He helps defend Winterfell from the White Walkers, then
      travels to King's Landing to help Dany win the throne. After she goes mad and destroys the capital, he stabs her
      and is exiled. Game of Thrones ends with Jon venturing beyond the Wall with the wildlings.

    <h2>
      Sansa Stark
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sansa Stark's journey in Game of Thrones begins when she's betrothed to Joffrey Baratheon, leaving her imprisoned
      in King's Landing for the first few seasons. Shortly after her escape, she's betrothed to Ramsay Bolton, who's
      even worse to her. Ultimately, Sansa learns from the likes of Cersei and Littlefinger on how to play the political
      game, developing a cunning that the likes of Ned and Jon Snow lack. She ends the show as Queen in the North,
      having established the territory as an independent land.

    <h2>
      Arya Stark
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arya Stark never fits into the Westerosi noblewoman mold, preferring to take sword fighting lessons and learn
      archery instead. After seeing her father killed, Arya sets out on a path of vengeance that leads her to the
      Faceless Assassins of Braavos. There, she trains to become "no one" before returning to Westeros to kill the likes
      of Walder Frey. In the Battle of Winterfell, Arya lands the killing blow on the Night King, ending the Long Night.
      At the end of the show, she becomes the captain of an exploration ship to venture west of Westeros.

    <h2>
      Bran Stark
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the incident in the Game of Thrones pilot leaves Bran without the use of his legs, he's beckoned beyond the
      Wall to begin his true journey. Bran is summoned by the Three-eyed Raven, a being with the ability to envision
      events from the past, present, and future. Bran Stark trains to develop these powers himself, eventually losing
      his humanity in the process. In the Game of Thrones ending, Bran becomes the King of Westeros, using his power to
      lead the kingdoms into a period of peace and prosperity.

    <h2>
      Rickon Stark
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rickon Stark is the youngest child of Ned and Catelyn, who most Game of Thrones audiences forgot existed. He does
      very little in the story aside from traveling north with Bran in the early seasons. Rickon's most memorable moment
      in Game of Thrones is his death in season 6, where he's sent to run across the battlefield while Ramsay Bolton
      fires arrows at him, eventually killing him.
